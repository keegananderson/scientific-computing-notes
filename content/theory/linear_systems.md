# Linear Systems

Many relationships in nature may be represented linearly, and often more complex
mathematical problems are approximated linearly.

\begin{equation*}
  A\vec{x} = \vec{b}
\end{equation*}
where $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$, $\vec{b} \in \mathbb{R}^m$, and
$\vec{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n$.
